<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>We’ll mostly be looking at how you design protocols with security in mind.</p>

<section id="key-requirements-for-security" class="level1">
<h1>Key Requirements for Security</h1>
<p>Confidentiality: only the sender and the intended recipients should be able to read/understand the message contents. Note that the contents could include the headers (as opposed to just the payload).</p>
<p>Authentication: sender and receiver need to confirm each other’s identities.</p>
<p>Message Integrity: the sender and receiver want to ensure that the message hasn’t been altered without detection.</p>
<p>Access and Availability: prevent activity that makes services inaccessible or unavailable to users.</p>
<p>Note you may not want all of these all the time – you may just want message integrity in a given instance, for example.</p>

<h1>Friends and Enemies</h1>
<p>Bob and Alice want to communicate securely over an unsafe channel. Trudy (an intruder) may intercept, delete, and/or add messages to the channel.</p>
</section>
<section id="network-security-threats" class="level1">
<h1>Network Security Threats</h1>
<p>Depending on the context, not all threats matter. Here are some potentially relevant ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>eavesdropping – someone is intercepting messages
<ul>
<li>this can be very hard to detect if the messages aren’t being modified</li>
</ul></li>
<li>actively inserting messages</li>
<li>impersonation – pretend to be somebody else
<ul>
<li>can construct arbitrary packets/frames with false addresses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>hijacking – take over ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver and replacing them with yourself</li>
<li>denial of service – prevent the service from being used by others</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cryptography" class="level1">
<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography refers to techniques for secure communication in the presence of third-parties.</p>
<p>It involves encryption, where a message is converted to an encoded message which is useless to an adversary.</p>
<p>It should be easy for a recipient to decode a message but very hard to a third-party.</p>
