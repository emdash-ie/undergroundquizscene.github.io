<h1>NAT – Network Address Translation</h1>
<p>Have the same external IP addresses for all interfaces on an internal network, and map different port values to different unique internal IP addresses.</p>
<p>Has the benefit that it doesn’t use up too many addresses, and also allows you to change the layout of your network much more freely.</p>
<p>Also, no-one can connect directly to your machine.</p>
<p>There are some situations (e.g. running a web server) where this is a disadvantage – you’d like to be able to connect to the internal computers from outside.</p>
<section id="things-to-worry-about" class="level2">
<h2>Things to Worry About</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Still limited to about 60,000 internal addresses per external address</p></li>
<li><p>Router is now doing quite a lot of work allocating port numbers for every flow</p></li>
<li><p>Routers should only process up to layer 3 – NAT violates the end-to-end argument.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>end-to-end: push functionality to edge of network, only do in the middle what’s absolutely necessary</p></li>
<li><p>p2p protocols have difficulty with NAT</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Address shortage should instead be solved by IPv6</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="nat-traversal-problem" class="level2">
<h2>Nat Traversal Problem</h2>
<p>Want to contact a server that’s behind NAT.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>solution 1 – static mapping (manually assign ports)</p></li>
<li><p>solution 2 – Universal Plug and Play</p>
<ul>
<li>automates static mapping, has lease times</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>solution 3 – relay (e.g. Skype)</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="icmp" class="level2">
<h2>ICMP</h2>
<p>This is a protocol that’s used by hosts &amp; routers to communicate network-level information:</p>
<ul>
<li>error reporting</li>
<li>echo request/reply (used by ping)</li>
</ul>
<p>Protocol doesn’t require responses (some people may not want to reply due to e.g. corporate sensitivity of info, etc.).</p>
<p>The protocol is a network-layer protocol above IP (ICMP messages stored in IP datagrams).</p>
<section id="traceroute-and-icmp" class="level3">
<h3>Traceroute and ICMP</h3>
<p>Send a series of UDP segments to the destination, with sequential TTL values. When the TTL expired ICMP responses come in, we know the first-hop, second-hop routers etc.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="ipv6" class="level2">
<h2>IPv6</h2>
<p>The initial motivation was that the 32-bit address space was soon to be completely allocated.</p>
<p>The key question was how to deal with the shortage of addresses.</p>
<p>Studied inefficiency of allocation in phone network hierarchical addressing, concluded that 128 bits were needed to account for that inefficiency.</p>
<p>However, now the IP header is going to be very big, leading to a lot of redundancy.</p>
<p>There’s now a 40-byte header (up from 20).</p>
<p>There were also some additional motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>make sure the new header format helps speed processing/forwarding</p></li>
<li><p>change the header to facilitate QoS</p>
<ul>
<li>the idea that some flows are more important than others</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>security</p>
<ul>
<li>not considered for IPv4</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>mobility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To save space, some things were removed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>checksum</p>
<ul>
<li><p>most link-layer protocols have their own methods of detecting bit errors, so it seems redundant</p></li>
<li><p>also because the TTL changes at each hop, the checksum has to be recalculated at every hop</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>fragmentation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>now packets that are too big will be dropped, and an ICMP message sent back to the sender to tell them to break it up and send it again</p></li>
<li><p>this simplifies things</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="ipv6-header" class="level3">
<h3>IPv6 Header</h3>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>priority</p>
<ul>
<li>used for QoS</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>flow label</p>
<ul>
<li>mark datagrams as being from the same flow</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>next header</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allow easy extension of header protocol with a reference to the next header (like in a linked list)</p></li>
<li><p>can add e.g. security headers or timing headers</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ipv6-addresses" class="level3">
<h3>IPv6 Addresses</h3>
<p>Classless addressing/routing (similar to CIDR)</p>
<p>Notation is 16-bit hex numbers separated by colons.</p>
<p>IPv6 adds explicit support for locally-unique addresses, and they have also reserved spaces within the address space and been careful about allocating addresses.</p>
</section>
<section id="ipv6-auto-configuration" class="level3">
<h3>IPv6 Auto-Configuration</h3>
<p>Replaces DHCP. Broadcast an address to the network to say you’re going to use it, asking if anyone else is using it.</p>

<h3>Transition From IPv4 to IPv6</h3>
<p>Not all routers can be upgraded simultaneously.</p>

<li><p>How will the network operate with mixed IPv4 and IPv6?</p>
