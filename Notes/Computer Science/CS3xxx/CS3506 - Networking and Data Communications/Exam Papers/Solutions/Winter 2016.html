<h1>Question 1</h1>

<h2>Part (a)</h2>
<p>You are asked to answer a series of short questions regarding IP addressing in the subnets containing hosts <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, referred to as subnets <code>netA</code> and <code>netB</code> respectively.</p>
<section id="i-how-many-ip-addresses-are-needed-in-each-of-the-two-subnets" class="level3">
<h3>(i) How many IP addresses are needed in each of the two subnets?</h3>
<p>Every node needs an IP address, as does each interface on the router, but the switches do not need IP addresses.</p>
<p><code>netA</code> has 6 hosts, and one router interface, and so needs 7 IP addresses. <code>netB</code> has 5 hosts, and one router interface, and so needs 6 IP addresses.</p>
<p>However, there should also be a broadcast address for each subnet, consisting of the prefix followed by all ones, bringing the number of IP addresses in <code>netA</code> up to 8, and in <code>netB</code> up to 7.</p>
</section>
<section id="ii-assign-an-ip-address-to-each-of-the-two-subnets.-your-subnet-addressings-should-use-the-smallest-amount-of-address-space-possible." class="level3">
<h3>(ii) Assign an IP address to each of the two subnets. Your subnet addressings should use the smallest amount of address space possible.</h3>
<p>We can assign subnet addresses with a precision of one bit in the IP address prefix – a prefix of 31 gives us 2 options, 30 gives 4, and 29 gives us 8 (because if 29 bits are fixed, 3 are free, giving 2^3 possible addresses). So a 29-bit prefix gives the smallest space that’s big enough.</p>
<p>To make things simple, I’m going with all-zero prefixes, giving 0.0.0.0/29 for <code>netA</code> and 0.0.0.8/29 for <code>netB</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="iii-assign-ip-addresses-in-these-ranges-to-each-of-the-two-hosts-a-and-b." class="level3">
<h3>(iii) Assign IP addresses in these ranges to each of the two hosts A and B.</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code>: 0.0.0.3</li>
<li><code>B</code>: 0.0.0.10</li>
</ul>
<p>To see why this is the case, look at the last byte in binary:</p>
<p><code>netA</code> has the last byte 0000 0000, with the first 5 bits fixed, and the last 3 free to vary. Using the number 3 for <code>A</code> gives 0000 0011, which fits those rules.</p>
<p><code>netB</code> has the last byte 0000 1000, with the first 5 bits fixed, and the last 3 free to vary. Using the number 10 for <code>B</code> gives 0000 1010, which also fits.</p>
<p>(<code>A</code> could have had any last digit from 0 to 6 inclusive (though not 7 because that would clash with the subnet broadcast address), and <code>B</code> could have had any from 8 to 14 inclusive – I picked these numbers just to show how it worked.)</p>

<section id="iv-what-ip-address-range-can-the-router-advertise-to-the-outside-for-all-of-the-hosts-reachable-in-these-two-subnets" class="level3">
<h3>(iv) What IP address range can the router advertise to the outside for all of the hosts reachable in these two subnets?</h3>
<p>It can advertise 0.0.0.0/28 – this means all but the last 5 digits are fixed at 0, and the rest can vary, which fits the addresses in the subnet.</p>
<p>(There will be 1 address that isn’t assigned to any host though, and is technically unreachable – I’m not sure how to square that one. I’m pretty sure this is still the correct answer, but if anyone has other suggestions, get on to me.)</p>
