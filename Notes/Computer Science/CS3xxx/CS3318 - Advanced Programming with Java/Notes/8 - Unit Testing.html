<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>There are a few kinds of tests performed by developers, e.g. unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.</p>
<p>System Under Test: the part of the system being tested</p>
<p>Depended On Component/Collaborator: an entity required by a system under test to fulfil its duties</p>
<p>In this module, we just look at unit testing.</p>
<section id="unit-tests" class="level2">
<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Focus on an individual class, and control all aspects of the test context by replacing real collaborators with test doubles.</p>
<p>Unit tests don’t consider the users of the system they test, and are unaware of layers, external systems, and resources.</p>
<p>Unit tests are the tests that will verify a class’ expected behaviour.</p>
<p>They serve as live documentation of the code.</p>
<p>You can turn the process of creating unit tests into a design activity – it gets you thinking about how your code is going to be used (the user’s perspective).</p>

<section id="interactions" class="level1">
<h1>Interactions</h1>
<p>Classes (with interactions?) can’t be thoroughly tested using just their API. You can test the interface but not correct operation.</p>

<h1>Unit Testing Frameworks</h1>
<p>JUnit is an open-source testing framework for Java. It was built for unit testing, but also supports other kinds of test.</p>
<p>JUnit is widely supported, and has a large number of third-party extensions.</p>
