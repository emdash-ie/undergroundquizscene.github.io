</header>
<section id="origin-and-values" class="level1">
<h1>Origin and Values</h1>
<p>XP is a set of practices – these weren’t new, but the best practices at the time. They were then taken to the extreme for XP.</p>
<p>Originally there were 12 practices, and it has since been expanded to 24 – we’ll only look at the 12.</p>
<section id="values" class="level2">
<h2>Values</h2>
<p>Extreme Programming is based on 5 values:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Courage</li>
<li>Respect</li>
</ol>
<p>(Don’t need to remember these, but need to be able to understand/explain them.)</p>
<section id="communication" class="level3">
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Different people have different knowledge and experience – communication is needed to exchange these.</p>
</section>
<section id="simplicity" class="level3">
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Focus on the simplest solution that works – aim to eliminate wasted effort on solutions that are overly complex, and not needed right now.</p>
</section>
<section id="feedback" class="level3">
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Requirements will change – the sooner you know about it, the better. Get feedback early and often.</p>
</section>
<section id="courage" class="level3">
<h3>4. Courage</h3>
<p>Speak unpleasant truths to foster communication and trust.</p>
<p>Discard failing solutions – don’t fall into the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
</section>
<section id="respect" class="level3">
<h3>5. Respect</h3>
<p>All members of a team must case about each other and the project.</p>
<p>Each person’s contributions and independence must be respected.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-customer-the-developer" class="level2">
<h2>The Customer &amp; the Developer</h2>
<p>The customer decides:</p>
<ul>
<li>the scope – what the system must do</li>
<li>the priority – what is most important</li>
<li>composition of releases</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The developers decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimated time to add a feature</li>
<li>technical consequences – explains the consequences of technical choices (but the customer makes the decision)</li>
<li>the process – how the team will work</li>
<li>detailed schedule – within a given iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is similar to the product owner and dev team in Scrum).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="practices" class="level1">
<h1>Practices</h1>
<section id="planning-game" class="level2">
<h2>1. Planning Game</h2>
<p>Plan for the upcoming iteration, based on user stories provided by the customer.</p>
<p>The dev team reviews user stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the time estimation / effort? […]</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="small-releases" class="level2">
<h2>2. Small Releases</h2>
<p>Release a working and tested software product as early as possible.</p>
<p>The first release is the minimum viable product. The customer uses the product as soon as possible and gives feedback.</p>
</section>
<section id="system-metaphor" class="level2">
<h2>3. System Metaphor</h2>
<p>A story that everyone (customers, programmers, managers) can tell about how the system works.</p>
<p>Example metaphors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop for GUIs</li>
<li>Shopping Cart in online shopping</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="simple-design" class="level2">
<h2>4. Simple Design</h2>
<p>The system design should be as simple as possible at any moment in time.</p>
<p>Always implement things when you actually need them – additional code (e.g. for things you may never need) is just pollution. You can’t anticipate feature changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-first-development" class="level2">
<h2>5. Test-first Development</h2>
<p>Testing is done first, and done throughout the process.</p>
<p>Write unit tests first, then write the code to pass those tests. This ensures the tests are written, and improves the testability of the system.</p>
<p>It also focuses the developer on what needs to be done – requirements as tests.</p>
<p>All tests should be automated.</p>
</section>
<section id="refactoring" class="level2">
<h2>6. Refactoring</h2>
<p>Improving the design of existing code.</p>
<p>Need this once changes have happened. Refactoring must make no changes to the software’s behaviour – can use unit tests to check this.</p>
<p>Done to keep the code as simple as possible, or to make it better/more efficient.</p>
<p>This works very well with test-first development and simple design.</p>
</section>
<section id="pair-programming" class="level2">
<h2>7. Pair Programming</h2>
<p>Have 2 people work on production code – they take turns typing and watching.</p>
<p>The Driver codes, and the Navigator asks questions and reviews the code continuously.</p>
<p>This can catch errors very quickly, but can be exhausting. You can rotate pairs to mix things up.</p>
</section>
<section id="continuous-integration" class="level2">
<h2>8. Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>New code is integrated into the main system no later than a few hours after it’s written, triggering a build from scratch.</p>
<p>Unit tests already exist, thanks to test-first development. These must all pass, otherwise the changes are rolled back and fixed.</p>
<p>CI has become a key practice independent from XP.</p>
</section>
<section id="collective-ownership" class="level2">
<h2>9. Collective Ownership</h2>
<p>All developers own all the code – everybody is responsible.</p>
<p>This facilitates refactoring, and helps mitigate the effect of team members leaving.</p>
<p>If anybody sees an opportunity to improve the code, they can/should go for it.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-site-customer" class="level2">
<h2>10. On-site Customer</h2>
<p>The customer of the software sits with the team to answer questions.</p>
<p>This isn’t always feasible, but can avoid working on assumptions, because you can always ask the customer.</p>
</section>
<section id="hour-workweeks" class="level2">
<h2>11. 40-hour Workweeks</h2>
<p>Work at a sustainable pace. Prevent regular overtime – it’s not sustainable.</p>
<p>40’s meant to be a guideline, not an exact number.</p>
</section>
<section id="open-workspace" class="level2">
<h2>12. Open Workspace</h2>
<p>Everybody works in an open workspace, usually with small private spaces around a central area.</p>
<p>The rationale is that this encourages regular conversations, and enables serendipitous communication – people can overhear useful things.</p>
<p>The room needs to be big enough, and lots of wall space should be allowed for whiteboards for design discussions.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-practice" class="level2">
<h2>In Practice</h2>
<p>Most teams don’t adopt all of these practices – one study found that no team used more than 8 of the practices.</p>
