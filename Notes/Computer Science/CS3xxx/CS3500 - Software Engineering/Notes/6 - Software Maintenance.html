<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Maintenance takes up 90% of the lifetime of software.</p>
<p>Software maintenance is the process of modifying software after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a change in an environment. A related term is software evolution, which refers to software as it is changed, adapted, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-maintenance" class="level1">
<h1>Types of Maintenance</h1>
<p>There are 4 types of maintenance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Corrective
<ul>
<li>Removal of bugs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adaptive
<ul>
<li>Adapt the software to a new environment without changing the functionality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perfective / Enhancements
<ul>
<li>Adding new functionality and features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preventive
<ul>
<li>Changes to improve maintainability of the system</li>
<li>Trying to pay off a technical debt</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="software-entropy" class="level1">
<h1>Software Entropy</h1>
<p>The tendency for software, over time, to become difficult and costly to maintain.</p>
</section>
<section id="technical-debt" class="level1">
<h1>Technical Debt</h1>
<p>Financial debt is a temporary shortage of money – debt implies that you’ll have the money later but not now.</p>
<p>Technical debt involves having a temporary shortage of time – you take shortcuts to get a software product delivered faster. You borrow time.</p>
<p>Technical debt reflects the cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.</p>
<section id="types" class="level2">
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Today technical debt can arguably be found in every step of the design process, not just in the coding.</p>

<section id="lehmans-program-classification" class="level1">
<h1>Lehman’s Program Classification</h1>
<p>Different types of software evolve in different ways.</p>
<section id="s-type-specification" class="level2">
<h2>S-Type: “Specification”</h2>
<p>A program that is correct in the mathematical sense, based on some formal specification.</p>
<p>An S-type program doesn’t change due to changing user-requirements. Typically such programs are algorithms, e.g. sin, compression algorithms.</p>
<section id="unsatisfactoriness" class="level3">
<h3>Unsatisfactoriness</h3>
<p>It may happen that S-type programs become unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Revising the specification leads to a new program […]</p>
<p>Programs don’t change – a change is a new program. (Except correcting defects.)</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="p-type-problem" class="level2">
<h2>P-Type: “Problem”</h2>
<p>A program that solves a problem that can be fully specified, but user’s concern is with correctness of results in a specific context.</p>
<p>Example: chess game</p>
<ul>
<li>rules of the game can be fully specified</li>
<li>procedure is to calculate the next best move</li>
<li>this may not be practically feasible</li>
<li>have to approximate the solution to be practical/feasible</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs to give acceptable results, e.g. 90% chance of rain for weather.</p>
</section>
<section id="e-type-evolving" class="level2">
<h2>E-Type: “Evolving”</h2>
<p>A program that operates in, or addresses a problem or activity of the real world.</p>
<p>The program becomes an integral part of the domain within which it operates.</p>
<p>To remain satisfactory to users, it must be continuously evolved.</p>
<p>Most software is E-type.</p>
<p>Changes are intended to improve the user satisfaction.</p>
</section>
<section id="lehmans-laws" class="level2">
<h2>Lehman’s Laws</h2>
<p>8 laws of how software evolves, based on observations. The laws only apply to E-type systems.</p>
<section id="law-1-continuing-change" class="level3">
<h3>Law 1: Continuing Change</h3>
<p>An E-type system must be continually adapted, else it becomes progressively less satisfactory in use.</p>
</section>
<section id="law-2-increasing-complexity" class="level3">
<h3>Law 2: Increasing Complexity</h3>
<p>As an E-type system is changed, its complexity increases and it becomes more difficult to evolve, unless work is done to maintain or reduce the complexity.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="key-challenge-in-maintenance" class="level1">
<h1>Key Challenge in Maintenance</h1>
<p>Most software development is bespoke, rather than market-targeted.</p>
<p>Most development is done in projects, where the team is disbanded after the project finishes.</p>
<p>Most maintenance is done by people other than those who wrote the code.</p>
