<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Co-ordination: […]</p>
<p>Communication: The exchange of complete and unambiguous information – that the sender and receiver can reach a common understanding.</p>
<p>Control: The process of adhering to goals, policies, standards, or quality levels.</p>

<h1>Outsourcing</h1>
<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to distance, which can be divided among temporal distance, geographical distance, and sociocultural distance.</p>

<section id="distributed-teams" class="level1">
<h1>Distributed Teams</h1>
<p>You can have a different team in each location, or you can have virtual teams, which span locations. These contrast with co-located teams.</p>
<section id="co-located-teams" class="level2">
<h2>Co-located Teams</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Frequent interactions, both formal and informal</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody knows everybody</p></li>
<li><p>Not much miscommunication</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness of what others are doing</p></li>
<li><p>Trust among team members (from knowing them and hanging out with them)</p></li>
<li><p>Shared understanding of the product</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="team-per-location" class="level2">
<h2>Team per Location</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Typically only formal interactions / planned meetings</p></li>
<li><p>Teams may not have met each other</p></li>
<li><p>Miscommunication</p></li>
<li><p>Teams don’t know what each other is doing</p></li>
<li><p>Teams have no reason to trust one another</p></li>
<li><p>No shared understanding</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conference Calls</h2>
<p>Conference calls don’t really solve this problem very well.</p>

<section id="brooks-law" class="level1">
<h1>Brooks’ Law</h1>
<p>Adding more manpower to a project that is already late makes it later.</p>
<section id="reasons" class="level2">
<h2>Reasons</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ramp-up time: It takes time for people to become productive on a project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They need to become familiar with the project.</p></li>
<li><p>People will actually start out negatively affecting productivity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Combination overheads: As you add more people you greatly increase the number of communication channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Limited divisibility of tasks: Tasks can only be decomposed to a certain level – after that people get in each other’s way</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="conways-law" class="level1">
<h1>Conway’s Law</h1>
<p>Any organisation that designs a system will produce a system whose structure is a copy of the organisation’s communication structure.</p>
<section id="example" class="level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A contract research organisation had eight people who were to produce a COBOL compiler and an ALGOL compiler.</p>
<p>After some initial estimates of difficulty and time, five people were assigned to the COBOL job and three to the ALGOL job.</p>
<p>The COBOL compiler ran in five phases, and the ALGOL compiler ran in three.</p>
</section>
<section id="explaining" class="level2">
<h2>Explaining</h2>
<p>Modules tend to be allocated to specific teams.</p>
<p>If two modules are interdependent, and there’s a different team for each module, the teams must negotiate an interface so that the modules can work together.</p>
</section>
<section id="implications" class="level2">
<h2>Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Organising design teams means that certain design decisions have already been made.</p></li>
<li><p>A higher level of organisational distribution leads to a more modular product design.</p></li>
<li><p>Once interfaces are established, you must continue to communicate and co-ordinate.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to change the architecture, you must also change the organisation.</p></li>
</ul>
