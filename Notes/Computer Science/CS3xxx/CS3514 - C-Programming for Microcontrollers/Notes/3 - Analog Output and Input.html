<h1>Analog Output</h1>
<p>The Arduino has an ADC but doesn’t have a DAC (digital to analog converter).</p>
<p>However, it can emulate this using pulse-width modulation. (Note only some specific pins can use PWM.)</p>

<section id="pwm" class="level1">
<h1>PWM</h1>
<p>In order to respond to a PWM signal, a device must have some characteristic that allows it to average the energy applied to it.</p>
<p>With a 50% duty cycle, the signal is on half the time and off half the time – it spends the same amount of time high as it does low in each cycle.</p>
<p>So the device sees about half the power. With an LED, the LED can flash very fast, but our eyes can’t keep up – with a 50% duty cycle, we see it as about half as bright. This is persistence of vision – you can look up some cool things on youtube.</p>
<p>A 10% duty cycle means the signal spends 10% of the time in the on phase.</p>
<p>You can also configure the frequency of the signal in the Arduino, but only between a couple of preset values.</p>
<p>For controlling the duty cycle from code, we write out a value between 0 and 255 – at 0 the signal is always low, at 255 the signal is always high.</p>
