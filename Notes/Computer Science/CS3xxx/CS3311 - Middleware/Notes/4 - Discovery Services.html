<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Sometimes users/applications need resources and services (e.g. hardware devices, storage, content servers, software) that aren’t available on their computers.</p>
<p>As the network is changing all the time, we need to be able to discover services at runtime.</p>
<p>Users want to be able to find services by specifying criteria – cost, trustworthiness, etc.</p>
<p>We’d like to describe services, e.g. using XML. This info can specify how to use the service as well as what it provides.</p>
<p>We’d also like the client and server to know when the other is no longer accessible. (provisioning?)</p>
</section>
<section id="examples" class="level1">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Bluetooth uses discovery and pairing to create an ad-hoc network between two devices, where each can act as server or client. Bluetooth is an interesting thing to look into if you’d like, especially recent developments.</p>
<p>With bluetooth the first step is to discover devices, and the second is to discover services.</p>
<p>Wifi Direct creates ad-hoc networks using wifi. One device is assigned as the group network, and this controls what happens, especially regarding energy use.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-a-directory" class="level1">
<h1>Using a Directory</h1>
<p>Similar to RMI Registries, you can use a directory services which provides information about available services.</p>
<p>This can be done with a centralised server or purely peer-to-peer.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-jini" class="level1">
<h1>Example: Jini</h1>
<ul>
<li>Similar to RMI, but with extra discovery service</li>
</ul>
<section id="discovery" class="level2">
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Services can be defined by their signatures.</p>
<p>Jini has a lookup service which stores which services are available and information about them.</p>
<p>Advertising of services is for a limited time – the services are leased. This is a significant difference from RMI. Clients may only get a period of access time for the service, and then will have to renew the connection. E.g. the service may be available for 1 hour, and a given client may get access only for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>There is a protocol (set of rules) for services to discover a lookup service and register themselves with it. This is the discovery/join protocol.</p>
<p>Multicast is used for finding the lookup service. Multicast addresses a subset of computers in a network, rather than specifying an individual computer (as you would with unicast) or everybody (as you would with broadcast).</p>
<p>Once the lookup service has been found, it sends the servers a proxy that will mediate communication between the server and the lookup registry.</p>
<p>The client can discover the lookup registry the same way, and then query it for the specific service it wants. It then receives a stub/proxy as with RMI.</p>
<p>Service access can be exclusive or non-exclusive.</p>
</section>
<section id="scalability" class="level2">
<h2>Scalability</h2>
<ul>
<li>A federation of lookup services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lookup services can register themselves with one another and balance the load geographically or based on requests.</p>
<p>A penalty here is longer resolution time to find a service if it’s not found in the first step.</p>
</section>
<section id="central-authority" class="level2">
<h2>Central Authority</h2>
<p>Note there is no central authority here that controls the system. The lookup is centralised, but the control isn’t.</p>
