<p>Functions don’t have to be about numbers. They are just mappings between elements of sets.</p>
<p>Function: a relationship between two sets, translating an input element to an output.</p>
<p>The concept of functions is used throughout computer science. We need to understand exactly what a function is, and understand the different properties it could have.</p>
<p>Think of a function as a machine - we feed it some input, and we get some output in return.</p>
<p>We don’t need to know what goes on inside the machine, all we care about is what output we get for different inputs.</p>
<p>What’s important is that we can only get one output from a particular input.</p>
<p>For mathematical functions, we can graph them.</p>
<p>Functions are more general than those seen in maths, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Given an ID number as input, a function returns the name of the student with that ID.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the text of an email, a function “encrypt” returns an encrypted version of the text.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let A and B be two non-empty sets. A <em>function</em> f from A to B specifies for each element of A exactly one element of B.</p>
<p>We write f:A→B.</p>
<p>A is the domain and B is the codomain.</p>
<section id="what-properties-must-a-function-have" class="level2">
<h2>What properties must a function have?</h2>
<p>Every element of the domain must be matched with exactly one element of the codomain, and not matched with anything else.</p>
<p>Can write them as:</p>
<p>f: R→R: x (maplet, basically → with a bar at the tail) 2x</p>

<section id="representing-functions" class="level2">
<h2>Representing functions</h2>
<p>In computer science we often represent functions as tables or matrices. Put the domain and codomain on the axes, specify the direction of f.</p>
<p>We can also use lookup tables.</p>
<p>Or an arrow diagram.</p>
<p>You can use a set of ordered pairs e.g. { (mallow, Cork), …}</p>
<p>We’ll use this representation most because it’s easy to follow.</p>

<section id="standard-function-concepts" class="level2">
<h2>Standard function concepts</h2>
<p>A function is linear if f(x) can be written f(x) = ax+ b for fixed integers a and b.</p>
<p>polynomial if f(x) = a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>(n-1)</sup> + … + a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>0</sup></p>
<p>exponential if f(x) contains a term a<sup>x</sup> for some fixed integer a</p>
