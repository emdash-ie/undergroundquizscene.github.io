<p>There will be two in-class tests. Those will probably be in week 6 (two weeks time) and week 10. Each will be worth 10% of the final grade.</p>
<p>There a Course Handout on the webpage, which has all the definitions that are in the course.</p>
<p>We won’t be asked for definitions in tests, but we will need to understand and be able to apply the definitions.</p>
<section id="an-introduction-to-relations" class="level1">
<h1>An Introduction to Relations</h1>
<p>A relation is a connection between sets of objects.</p>
<section id="networking" class="level2">
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>Networks (connecting various devices) have topologies.</p>
<p>E.g. Ring, Star, etc.</p>
<p>For facebook, it’s a graph of users, with relations indicating who is friends with who.</p>
</section>
<section id="relational-databases" class="level2">
<h2>Relational Databases</h2>
<p>Main questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to avoid redundant info?</p></li>
<li><p>How to ensure updates are consistent?</p></li>
<li><p>How to distinguish between different entities, or recognise that two are the same?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Use multiple tables. Each one is a relation, e.g. “is a mentor of”.</p>
<p>For the moment we’ll only consider relations between two sets, e.g. title and genre.</p>
</section>
<section id="representing-relations" class="level2">
<h2>Representing Relations</h2>
<p>Can use a matrix, with the (e.g.) module codes on one axis, students on another, and an X where the student is taking that module.</p>
<p>Can use a table, with one column of codes and one of students, but there’s a lot of repetition of module codes then.</p>
<p>Can use a set of ordered pairs.</p>
<p>Can use an arrow diagram.</p>
<p>We will mostly use ordered-pair notation. This allows us to use set notation.</p>
<p>R is a relation between two sets A and B if and only if<br />
R ⊆ A x B.</p>
<p>“is_the_square_of” ⊆ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} x {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}</p>
<p>“is_the_square_of” = { (0,0), (1,1), (4,2), (9,3) }</p>
</section>
<section id="notations" class="level2">
<h2>Notations:</h2>
<p>Infix notation: a R b e.g. 2 is_a_divisor_of 6</p>
<p>Prefix notation: R(a, b)</p>
<p>Element notation: (a, b) ∈ R</p>
<p>Examples of binary relations are: (&lt;, =, etc.)</p>
<p>Note that relations are ordered.<br />
(2,6) ∈ “is_a_divisor_of” but (6,2) isn’t.</p>
<p>Every relation has an inverse.</p>
<p>If R ⊆ A x B, then (a, b) ∈ R if and only if (b, a) ∈ R<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>A function is a special type of relation.</p>
</section>
<section id="functional-relations" class="level2">
<h2>Functional Relations</h2>
<p>A binary relation is a <em>function relation</em> if and only if for each a ∈ A there is exactly one b ∈ B such that (a,b) ∈ R.</p>
<p>A relation with the properties of a function, more or less.</p>
