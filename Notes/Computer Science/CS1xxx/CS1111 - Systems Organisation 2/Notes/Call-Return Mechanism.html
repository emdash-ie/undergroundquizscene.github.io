<h1>Call-Return Mechanism</h1>
<hr />
<p>The call-return mechanism provides low-level implementation for subroutines<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<section id="subroutines" class="level2">
<h2>Subroutines</h2>
<p>We typically break problems down into smaller problems when solving them. If we have smaller problems that we solve many times, subroutines are useful to solve those smaller problems.</p>
<section id="the-call-instruction" class="level3">
<h3>The <em>call</em> Instruction</h3>
<p>This instruction does a number of things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transfers control to the called subroutine by placing the subroutine address into the instruction pointer.</li>
<li>Pushes the return address (the address of the instruction that follows the call instruction in memory) onto the stack.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: the stack is used because of the First In, Last Out nature it has, which allows us to call subroutines within other subroutines using the same mechanism.</p>
<p>The format of the call instruction in samphire is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>call address</code></pre>
<p>Where ‘address’ is the memory address of the start of the subroutine.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-org-instruction" class="level3">
<h3>The <em>org</em> Instruction</h3>
<p>In Samphire, the org instruction tells the assembler to place the following instructions into memory starting at a specific address.</p>
<p>We can also use the org instruction to put data into memory, which is a very useful application.</p>
<p>The format looks like this (in Samphire):</p>
<pre><code>org address</code></pre>
<p>Where address is the address at which the assembler should place the instructions.</p>
<p>This instruction can be used to place a subroutine into memory at a known address.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ret-instruction" class="level3">
<h3>The <em>ret</em> Instruction</h3>
<p>This instruction pops the return address from the stack into the Instruction Pointer.</p>
<p>We can use it to return to the main routine from a subroutine.</p>
</section>
<section id="example" class="level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>mov al, 10
call 70             ; Subroutine call
mov [c0], al

org 70
add al, 1           ; The subroutine
ret

end</code></pre>
</section>
</section>
<section id="subroutines-with-the-traffic-lights" class="level2">
<h2>Subroutines with the Traffic Lights</h2>
<p>Here’s some code:</p>
<pre><code>start:
mov al, 84          
out 01              ; red, green
mov bl, ff
call 70

mov al, 48
out 01              ; orange, orange
mov bl, 10
call 70

mov al, 30          
out 01              ; green, red
mov bl, ff
call 70

mov al 48
out 01              ; orange, orange
mov bl, 10
call 70

jmp start

org 70
in_delay:
dec bl
cmp bl, 00
jnz in_delay
ret

end</code></pre>
<p>This code simulates a set of traffic lights, and the call function is used to add a delay at each point, with the length of delay specified by the value in bl.</p>
