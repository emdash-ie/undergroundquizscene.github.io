<h1>8 Queens Problem</h1>
<hr />
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A chessboard is an 8 x 8 board of squares.</p>
<p>A queen (in chess) can move vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, any number of squares.</p>
<p>If there’s another piece on a square the queen can move to, the queen can capture that piece by moving to that square.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem" class="level2">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Can you fit 8 queens on the board such that none can capture another?</p>
<p>How might you systematically try to come up with an arrangement of 8 queens on a chessboard?</p>
</section>
<section id="solution" class="level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Take a 4 x 4 board as an example, and attempt that.</p>
<section id="representing-the-board" class="level3">
<h3>Representing the Board</h3>
<p>Since you can only have one queen on each row, you can use a single list with the positions of each queen in each row to represent the board:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 3, 0, 2]</code></pre>
<p>The above list represents a 4 x 4 board with a queens in positions (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), and (3, 2), where each pair is (row, column).</p>
<p>Since we’ll know the size of the board at all times in the function, we’ll just use the list to track occupied rows, so that this list:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 3]</code></pre>
<p>Represents a board (of any size) with a queen at position 1 in the first row and another at position 2 in the second row.</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-a-new-position" class="level3">
<h3>Checking a New Position</h3>
<p>With each new position, we need to make sure it’s not under attack from any placed queen. We must check vertically and diagonally. (We only ever place one queen on a row, so we don’t need to worry about horizontal threats.)</p>
<section id="vertically" class="level4">
<h4>Vertically</h4>
<p>Walk through the list of existing queens and check that the suggested position is not already in the list. (If you’re trying to put a queen in position 0 in the current row, make sure there’s no 0 in the list.)</p>
</section>
<section id="diagonally" class="level4">
<h4>Diagonally</h4>
<p>We need to check squares along two diagonals, where the co-ordinates are worked out for the first by decreasing the row and decreasing the column, and for the second by decreasing the row but increasing the column, in steps of 1 each time.</p>
