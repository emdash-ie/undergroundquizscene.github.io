<h1>The Spring Exam</h1>
<hr />
<p>The exam will be a take-home exam.<br />
Here are some details:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s mainly to prepare us for the summer exam, as it’s a bit weird to be switching from labs with computers to exams with paper and pencil.</li>
<li>There will be a small number of marks going for the spring exam. It will be counted as one of the assignments, and then the lowest assignment score will be dropped, which may well be the spring exam itself.</li>
<li>It will be passed out in class on Monday 14th March, and will be collected in class on Friday 18th March, at the beginning of the class. You will not be able to get it unless you’re in class on Monday morning. I’ll scan it, but you won’t be able to submit a printout of that, unfortunately.</li>
<li>You don’t have to do it in 3 hours as if it’s the summer exam, but it’s highly recommended, to give proper preparation for the summer exam. Alternatively you can do it in your own time and time how long it takes.</li>
<li>Do not use a computer or your notes when doing this exam. Do not ask other people how they’re doing or anything.</li>
<li>No labs next week, as we have this exam.</li>
<li>5 questions, do all questions, each question worth 20%.</li>
<li>Further mark divisions indicated on the paper.</li>
<li>Write answers on the question paper</li>
<li>You can use additional paper for drafts and roughwork.</li>
<li>For both this and the summer exam:
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to comment any of your code, except for helper functions that he didn’t ask for (which you’re welcome to create).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s a reasonably tough exam, and the summer exam will not be harder.</li>
</ul>
