<li>No new Python is required for this assignment.</li>

<h2>FindNumber()</h2>
<p>The first question is the reverse of the number-guessing game we played with the computer at the start of the year. This time we think of the number, and the computer tries to guess it, with us telling the computer whether each guess is too high, too low, or is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike before, the number that needs to be guessed can be any positive number.</li>
<li>The correct solution will be relatively quick even for very large numbers (unlike guessing each number in turn, e.g. 1? 2? 3?…)</li>
</ul>

<h2>MinPos()</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can assume that there are no duplicate numbers in the input list.</li>
<li>The list is a sorted list that has been rotated through the endpoint of the list. See the examples on the assignment to make that clear.</li>
<li>Pay attention to efficiency, try not to look at too many of the elements.</li>
</ul>
