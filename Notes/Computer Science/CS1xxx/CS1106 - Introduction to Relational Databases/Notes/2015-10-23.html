<section id="subqueries" class="level1">
<h1>Subqueries</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Often an alternative to joins</p></li>
<li><p>May be more intuitive or clearer</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="set-operations" class="level2">
<h2>Set operations</h2>
<section id="intersection" class="level3">
<h3>Intersection</h3>
<p>Let’s use this to find the films with both Humphrey Bogart and Katharin Hepburn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(</p>
<p>SELECT movieid<br />
FROM actors<br />
JOIN castings<br />
ON actor.id = castings.actorid<br />
WHERE actor.name = ‘Humphrey Bogart’</p>
<p>)<br />
INTERSECT<br />
(</p>
<p>…<br />
WHERE actor.name = ‘Katharine Hepburn’</p>
<p>);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, INTERSECTION is not supported by MySQL.</p>
</section>
<section id="union" class="level3">
<h3>Union</h3>
<p>UNION <em>is</em> supported by MySQL.</p>
<p>Let’s list the ids of all actors whose name is ‘Jack’ or who have at least ten films to their credit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>( /*ids of actors named Jack*/<br />
(<br />
UNION<br />
( /*ids of actors with at least ten films*/<br />
);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For UNION, the subquery results must have the same number of columns and column types. The columns must also have the same names.</p>
<p>SQL normally allows duplicates, but UNION suppresses them by default. This makes sense with sets.</p>
<p>If you need duplicates, you can use UNION ALL.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-film-has-greatest-score" class="level2">
<h2>What film has greatest score?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SELECT title, score<br />
FROM movies<br />
WHERE score =<br />
( SELECT MAX(score)</p>
<p>FROM movies</p>
<p>);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inner subquery will return the max score (wrapped in a 1x1 table), and the outer query uses this value in its WHERE clause.</p>
</section>
<section id="which-actors-appeared-in-the-godfather" class="level2">
<h2>Which actors appeared in “The Godfather”?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SELECT actorid<br />
FROM castings<br />
WHERE movieid =<br />
( SELECT id</p>
<p>FROM movies<br />
WHERE title = ‘Godfather, The’</p>
<p>);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that if there’s more than one movie with that name, we’ll be comparing a value (movieid) with a list, which won’t make sense with ‘=’.</p>
<p>We can use IN instead, as described below.</p>
</section>
<section id="conditions-involving-relations" class="level2">
<h2>Conditions Involving Relations</h2>
<p>Tables with a single column are known as unary relations, essentially lists.</p>
<p>SQL provides some Boolean functions that operate on these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>EXISTS R: true if R is not empty</p></li>
<li><p>s IN R: true if s is one of the values in R</p></li>
<li><p>s NOT IN R: opposite to above</p></li>
<li><p>s &gt; ALL R: true if s is greater than each and every value in R</p></li>
<li><p>s &gt; ANY R: true if s is greater than any one value in R</p></li>
<li><p>These two above can use any comparative operator.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="subqueries-returning-multi-column-tables" class="level2">
<h2>Subqueries returning multi-column tables</h2>
<p>We can use subqueries instead of table names in FROM clauses.</p>
<p>In this case you must give the subquery an alias, so that you can refer to it in the SELECT and WHERE clauses.</p>
<section id="whats-the-greatest-number-of-films-made-by-any-actor" class="level3">
<h3>What’s the greatest number of films made by any actor?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SELECT MAX(num_films)<br />
FROM<br />
( SELECT actorid, COUNT(movieid) AS ‘num_films’<br />
FROM castings<br />
GROUP BY actorid<br />
) AS film_counts;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the subquery returns a two-column, multi-row table (actors and the number of their films there are).</p>
