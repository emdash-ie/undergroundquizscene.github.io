<h1>Human Memory</h1>
<p>Memory is one of the most important features for interacting with software. We don’t want software to provide a high load for human memory.</p>
<p>The human memory has three distinct stages. Information is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Received through one or more of the <em>sensory memories</em>, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>Iconic (visual) memory</li>
<li>Echoic (auditory) memory</li>
<li>Haptic memory</li>
<li>These memories are very detailed.</li>
<li>They are specific to the medium they are storing, unlike short-term memory, which is more abstract and independent of the senses.</li>
<li>Kind of raw sensation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Selectively held in <em>short-term memory</em> while it is analysed, after which it may be either discarded or:
<ul>
<li>This is independent of the senses and more abstract than sensory memories</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stored permanently in <em>long-term memory</em>.
<ul>
<li>We store a description (maybe a very rich description) of the sensory memories.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>How can we use this transit to our advantage?</p>
<section id="sensory-memories" class="level2">
<h2>Sensory Memories</h2>
<p>These store raw memories (images, sounds, etc.) for very short periods of time (typically just a few seconds).</p>
<p>We can store things for longer if we get no new stimuli/sensations.</p>
<p>E.g. if we have no new visual stimuli, we can hold raw memory of a visual stimulus for longer.</p>
<p>He’ll talk later about how we know how these work.</p>
</section>
<section id="short-term-memory" class="level2">
<h2>Short-term Memory</h2>
<p>Short-term memory involves largely conscious recall of information.</p>
<p>Information held in the sensory memories may be passed to the short-term memory for analysis and processing.</p>
<p>However, the capacity of STM is limited and hence only some sensory information receives attention.</p>
<p>Information held in short-term memory can be accessed in around 70ms.</p>
<p>The short-term memory can hold around seven items of information (“seven plus or minus two” – Miller, 1956). However, is it not easy to define an item of information. It might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single digit or character or word</li>
<li>A long number or entire phrase, if that number or phrase is already known to the person</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you hear an unfamiliar place-name, you may initially store it as a sequence of syllables. Once you become familiar with the name, it can be stored as a single item in short-term memory.</p>
<p>When hearing a series of numbers, some people stored 7 separate numbers, and some people stored patterns in the numbers, e.g. “my telephone number”.</p>
<p>Storing information in short-term memory involves mental effort.</p>
<p>Because of this, information held in STM is easily lost:</p>
<ul>
<li>an interruption may demand our attention, forcing other information out of STM</li>
<li>it’s difficult to maintain information in STM for more than very short periods, so a long delay may result in items being lost</li>
<li>information is discarded when it no longer appears useful, so e.g. completing a task may cause us to flush all associated information from STM</li>
</ul>
<section id="example-atm" class="level3">
<h3>Example: ATM</h3>
<p>Early ATMs varied in the order in which they performed these tasks. Most returned the card last of all, when all requested services had been completed.</p>
<p>Users left after collecting their money or balance statement. They forgot to collect their card, because collecting the money was the primary task.</p>
<p>Collecting the card was a secondary task. On completion of a primary task, secondary tasks are often forgotten.</p>
<p>Most modern ATMs return the card before carrying out the requested services. This was it’s harder to leave the card behind.</p>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short-term memory is the gateway to long-term memory. Information is held in STM while is it being learned.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t take anything into our long-term memory without conscious thought.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="long-term-memory" class="level2">
<h2>Long-term Memory</h2>
<p>Long-term memory provides permanent storage of information. Information held in long-term memory can be accessed in around 100 ms.</p>
<p>The capacity of long-term memory is huge, apparently unlimited. Forgetting takes place slowly, if at all.</p>
<p>Recall after a few hours or days is usually no different from recall after a few minutes. Decay stabilises vs. short-term memory.</p>
<p>If information makes it to long-term memory, it is effortless to store it.</p>
<p>There are three main processes associated with long-term memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage/learning</li>
<li>Information retrieval</li>
<li>Forgetting
<ul>
<li>Also how we confuse things</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="storagelearning" class="level3">
<h3>Storage/learning</h3>
<p>Information passes into long-term memory via the short-term memory.</p>
<p>Not everything that is held in short-term memory is eventually stored in long-term memory.</p>
<p>The main factors determining what is stored are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal
<ul>
<li>If you rehearse something enough, you can transfer almost anything into memory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meaning
<ul>
<li>If something is meaningful to you, you will store it much more quickly</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Long-term Memory (continued)</h2>
<section id="storagelearning-1" class="level3">
<h3>Storage/Learning</h3>
<p>Rehearsal (repeated exposure to data or consideration of it) increases the likelihood that it will be stored in LTM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ebbinghaus found that the likelihood of long-term recall is directly proportional to the total period of exposure to the material – the total time hypothesis.</p></li>
<li>Baddeley found that the likelihood of long-term recall varied according to the pattern of exposure rather than the total period.
<ul>
<li>Brief but regular exposure produced long-term recall more effectively than infrequent, prolonged exposure – the distribution of practice effect.</li>
<li>Though it might be to do with re-ordering of info by the brain when you sleep.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful information is more likely to be stored in LTM than meaningless data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bartlett found that subjects who were asked to learn a story about an unfamiliar culture tended to recast the story within their own culture, and this aided recall.</li>
<li>He coined the phrase effort after meaning to describe the way in which people organise information to make it easier to recall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning may be improved by reinforcement through several senses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baddeley notes that performing any kind of action while reading or listening to material increases the likelihood that it will be recalled.
<ul>
<li>Using key-clicks to cycles through a list promotes learning more than merely pressing once to access the entire list.</li>
<li>The key-clicks help create a richer memory trace</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Research has also shown that reading material and hearing it spoken at the same time improves recall.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t seem to make much difference whether the spoken version is produced by another voice or by the reader’s own voice.
<ul>
<li>This may be why people often read aloud when trying to memorise something: reading aloud or even mouthing the words silently (sub-vocalisation) - improves recall.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="information-retrieval" class="level3">
<h3>Information Retrieval</h3>
<p>There are two types of information retrieval from LTM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recall: The recovery of information as a result of a conscious search</li>
<li>Recognition: The automatic recovery of information as a result of an external stimulus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognition is the less complex cognitive activity, and is almost instant.</p>
<p>For this reason, modern computer interfaces rely heavily on recognition rather than recall.</p>
<p>Instead of having to recall commands - as in a command-line system - users merely have to recognise commands from menus.</p>
<section id="recall" class="level4">
<h4>Recall</h4>
<p>During recall, we access long-term memory either episodically or semantically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Episodic memory represent our memory of events and experiences.
<ul>
<li>It allows us to access items in serial form, reconstructing sequences of events and experiences from earlier points in our lives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semantic memory represents relationships between information.
<ul>
<li>It allows us to access information without regard to the order in which it was acquired or the sense through which it was acquired.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic memory is assumed to be arranged as a semantic network.</p>
<p>Items are arranged in classes, and may inherit attributes from parent classes.</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that the delays which occur in recall can be modelled accurately as a network. The greater the number of levels in the hierarchy that have to be traversed, the longer the recall.</p>
<p>We don’t know that this is the way it works, but it fits the facts.</p>
<p>Recognition jumps straight into the network instead of having to traverse it.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="forgetting" class="level3">
<h3>Forgetting</h3>
<p>There are two main theories to explain the loss of information from long-term memory: decay and interference.</p>
<ul>
<li>decay: Ebbinghaus concluded that information is lost through natural decay.
<ul>
<li>His experiments suggested that the decay is exponential, i.e. information is lost rapidly at first but then more slowly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interference: new information may replace or corrupt older information
<ul>
<li>For example, changing your telephone number may cause you to forget your old number
<ul>
<li>This is known as retroactive interference</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, there may also be times when older information ‘resurfaces’ and becomes confused with newer information
<ul>
<li>For example, you may suddenly recall an old telephone number and confuse it with your new one.</li>
<li>This is known as proactive inhibition.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Many psychologists believe that we never really forget anything - we just lose access to certain parts of the stored information.</p>
<p>This is almost impossible to prove, since losing access to data has the same effect as losing the data.</p>
<p>However, phenomena such as proactive inhibition suggest that information remains stored even when it appears to have been lost.</p>

<h1>Memory Use and Computer Interaction</h1>
<p>When using a computer, human memory is used to store various types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term memory:
<ul>
<li>System commands, features, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Short-term memory:
<ul>
<li><em>status variables</em> such as position within task sequence, current mode, etc.</li>
<li><em>task variables</em> such as factors affecting your choices, selections previously made, etc.</li>
<li><em>new system knowledge/skills</em> such as commands, features, etc.</li>
<li><em>new non-system knowledge/skills</em> such as e-learning content</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="long-term-memory-1" class="level2">
<h2>Long-term Memory</h2>
<p>Generally not seen as that big an issue compared to short-term memory.</p>
<p>The main concern in relation to LTM is supporting recognition rather than recall. Some techniques are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose meaningful icons, command/function names</li>
<li>Use appropriate screen layout, grouping of icons, menu structure, etc. so that icons and menu items are easy to find</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="short-term-memory-1" class="level2">
<h2>Short-term Memory</h2>
<p>The main concerns in relation to short-term memory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimising the load presented at any one time</li>
<li>minimising the period for which items have to be remembered</li>
</ul>
<p>Various techniques can be used to minimise the problems posed by status variables, task variables, and the learning of new knowledge/skills.</p>
<section id="status-variables" class="level3">
<h3>Status Variables</h3>
<ul>
<li>identify options which have been selected of rejected (e.g. by providing a summary)</li>
<li>identify visited links (by changing their colour)</li>
<li>minimise the use of modes and/or provide visual reminders (e.g. changing cursor shape or screen layout)</li>
<li>users may forget what they’re waiting for if a response is too slow or a sequence is too complex, so provide:
<ul>
<li>summaries of requested data, search terms, etc.</li>
<li>maps/overviews of search paths</li>
<li>visual reminders of status, e.g. breadcrumb trails</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="task-variables" class="level3">
<h3>Task Variables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Place relevant information on one screen (use screen as external memory)
<ul>
<li>e.g. allow side-by-side comparison of products
<ul>
<li>moving backwards and forwards between pages to compare products is very demanding on memory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>use a consistent data format to simplify consideration/comparison</li>
<li>highlight similarities/differences</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allow users to make selections/vary parameters/etc. and see the results continuously rather than discretely
<ul>
<li>e.g. use a slider to set maximum price, update display as slider is moved</li>
<li>This could be described as using sensory memory (specifically visual memory) rather than short-term memory</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="material-to-be-learned" class="level3">
<h3>Material to Be Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make terms meaningful
<ul>
<li>Use a consistent naming convention, consistent syntax</li>
<li>Place them within a relevant structure (e.g. spatial layout)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allow users to explore material through multiple modalities
