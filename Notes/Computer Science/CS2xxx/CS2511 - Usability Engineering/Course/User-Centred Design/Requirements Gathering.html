<h1>Usability Design Process</h1>
<ul>
<li>Often good to have a mix of approaches and know which to use best for different circumstances</li>
</ul>
<section id="what-is-the-area-of-expertise" class="level2">
<h2>What Is the Area of Expertise?</h2>
<ul>
<li>pen-and-paper walkthrough is without a computer in sight
<ul>
<li>they have to think about it as they do it, so it becomes a very honest representation</li>
<li>you can find which steps are easily forgotten</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="who-are-the-users" class="level2">
<h2>Who Are the Users?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>what are they good at?</p></li>
<li>attitude = motivation
<ul>
<li>e.g. fun?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>generally better to design for small, tightly-defined groups</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="segmentation" class="level3">
<h3>Segmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Place people along axes for each criterion</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="personas" class="level3">
<h3>Personas</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes it easier for the designer to think about the groups – e.g. “how would ‘George’ find this?”</p></li>
<li><p>better than e.g. a really large requirements document</p></li>

<section id="personas-1" class="level1">
<h1>Personas</h1>
<ul>
<li>It has been found that a product developed to meet the specific needs of a particular group often meets the needs of a much wider group.
<ul>
<li>Rolling luggage was originally designed for airline pilots and air crew</li>
<li>ballpoint pens were originally designed for people who didn’t have the hand-eye co-ordination to use fountain pens</li>
<li>cassette tapes were originally designed for blind people (who couldn’t thread reel-to-reel tape)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="primary-users-and-secondary-users" class="level2">
<h2>Primary Users and Secondary Users</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is less common nowadays</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: a ticket-booking system</p>
<ul>
<li>primary users are sales assistants</li>
<li>secondary users are customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs of the two groups may be different. Both sets of needs should be identified and catered for.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-the-users-want-to-do" class="level2">
<h2>What Do the Users Want to Do?</h2>
<p>Need to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>normative needs
<ul>
<li>needs identified by professional designers/developers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>user needs
<ul>
<li>expressed needs
<ul>
<li>what end-users say they want</li>
</ul></li>
<li>felt needs
<ul>
<li>what end-users actually want from the system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Users may lack the technical vocabulary or understanding to express felt needs. Unmet felt needs are often expressed as a general dissatisfaction with a system. Users will often not use the system in this case.</p>
<p>This is a huge problem which has never been fully solved (e.g. the NHS computerised database system).</p>
<p>Sometimes end-user needs may be excessive and impractical, but this does not mean they can be ignored. You should explain why you’ve designed it in a different way from that.</p>
</section>
<section id="determining-user-needs" class="level2">
<h2>Determining User Needs</h2>
<p>The traditional methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct observation
<ul>
<li>though people may behave different when observed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>questionnaires</li>
<li>interviews</li>
</ul>
<section id="direct-observation" class="level3">
<h3>Direct Observation</h3>
<p>You can study existing users of similar systems.</p>
<p>Ideally you should observe people who are using the system for their own ends, unprompted by you.</p>
<p>For example, if the task is to develop a better ATM interface, you could use video to monitor people using existing ATMs and note any problems they encounter.</p>
<p>This is rarely possible, due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ethics/confidentiality issues</li>
<li>work is distributed over different places</li>
<li>work is done co-operatively</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative is to ask a group of people to carry out certain relevant operations in the laboratory, and then observe them.</p>
<p>This gives no guarantee that they are carrying out the same operations in the same way as they would if unprompted.</p>
<p>Might be worth using both techniques in parallel though.</p>
<section id="artefacts" class="level4">
<h4>Artefacts</h4>
<p>Where an application is based on existing systems, it may be possible to use an artefact (an object or aid used in the performance of a task) to identify non-normative needs.</p>
<p>This can tell you which parts of the process are difficult, or provide clues as to how users work with a system and what problems they encounter. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes stuck to the computer detailing keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>reference manuals kept close at hand (perhaps with some pages well-thumbed), or photocopied sheets from reference manuals pinned in a prominent position
<ul>
<li>shows which things people find difficult to remember</li>
</ul></li>
<li>manuals created by the users themselves</li>
<li>computer keys tippexed and drawn over with reminders of shortcuts, etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="questionnaires" class="level3">
<h3>Questionnaires</h3>
<p>Questions might cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>how much experience they have with relevant systems</li>
<li>did they encounter particular problems?</li>
<li>if they have tried competing systems, did they find one easier to use than another, and if so then in what way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questioning can be carried out through questionnaires or interviews.</p>
<p>Good questionnaire has 10-15 questions and no more – if you can’t find it out with that many questions, you need to use another method.</p>
<p>Closed questions are ones where the user is choosing preset answers, open questions allow the user to put in their own answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>designer/developer inevitably starts from their own perspective, and is most like</li>
<li></li>
<li>there are ways for checking a questionnaire for normative bias, but this won’t identify topics excluded altogether by bias</li>
<li>important to get the questionnaire reviewed by others</li>
<li>can be good to get a test run
<ul>
<li>ask something like “did this questionnaire seem to be in favour of software A or software B?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="interviews" class="level3">
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<p>Can use walkthroughs where direct observation and questionnaires won’t work.</p>
<p>These are conducted during face-to-face interviews, with pen and paper only.</p>
<p>This allows the subject to describe the process as they see it rather than as it is usually carried out.</p>
<p>Tells you which steps in a process are important to the user. Missing steps suggest that they are easily forgotten – may have to remind users.</p>
<p>Walkthroughs can be conducted at any stage of the design process.</p>
<p>Can also be a good sign of what to put in a questionnaire.</p>
<section id="compared-to-questionnaires" class="level4">
<h4>Compared to Questionnaires</h4>
<ul>
<li>interviews are usually less structured
<ul>
<li>this can be overcome to some extent by having the interviewer use a fixed list of questions</li>
<li>this removes the main advantage of an interview – the opportunity to ask questions spontaneously as they arise</li>
</ul></li>
<li>questionnaires provide a more formal structure setting than interviews, ensuring consistency between respondents
<ul>
<li>removes the risk of bias from an interviewer, ensuring respondents are free to provide their own perspective</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Often good to use both.</p>

<section id="how-will-the-application-be-used" class="level1">
<h1>How Will the Application Be Used?</h1>
<p>Consider an ATM:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will be used outside, so it must be usable in all weathers</li>
<li>screen must be viewable under all lighting conditions
<ul>
<li>and you may want a simple screen layout</li>
</ul></li>
<li>users might be wearing heavy clothing that impedes movement and makes them clumsier
<ul>
<li>might not want complicated interaction techniques</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, users may only be able to devote part of their attention to the task because:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are surrounded by other people and feel pressured or concerned about their privacy</li>
<li>they are simultaneously trying to control small children</li>
<li>they may be driving</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications on PCs and mobile devices generally pose fewer problems since the user has more control over where and how. There may still be issues with distraction, privacy, etc.</p>
<p>Issues to be considered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical aspects
<ul>
<li>lighting, noise levels, space/layout</li>
</ul></li>
<li>safety aspects
<ul>
<li>distractions (for safety-critical systems)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>social aspects
<ul>
<li>individual or group working, task-sharing or dependency, etc.
<ul>
<li>which data is shared between people in a group, how much</li>
<li>role of each person in the group, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>organisational aspects
<ul>
<li>IT policy, user support, etc.
<ul>
<li>e.g. permissions to access documents</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
