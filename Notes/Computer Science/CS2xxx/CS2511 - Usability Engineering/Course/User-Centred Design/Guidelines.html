<h1>Guidelines</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>recently, the aim is to remind people of certain things, rather than tell them</p></li>
<li><p>some guidelines are about branding as well as usability, e.g. Apple’s guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>because guidelines are missing a lot of information, they need to be interpreted carefully</p></li>
<li><p>exam questions in this area are likely to be “here’s a guideline, how is this likely to be applied in certain situations?” or “what is this guideline about?”</p></li>
<li><p>guidelines and the use of personas are meant to help you remember</p></li>

<h3>4 Principles</h3>

<ul>
<li>users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can’t be invisible to all of <em>their</em> senses)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Operable</p>
<ul>
<li>users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Understandable</p>
<ul>
<li>users must be able to understand the information in the interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Robust</p>
<ul>
<li><p>users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</p></li>
<li><p>use stuff that’s likely to be supported going forward</p></li>

<section id="perceivable" class="level4">
<h4>Perceivable</h4>
<section id="section" class="level5">
<h5>1.1</h5>
<p>Perceivable – 1.1 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. use <code>name</code> and/or <code>alt</code> to identify the purpose and/or describe the content of all non-text elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>controls/inputs</p></li>
<li><p>time-based media (dealt with elsewhere)</p></li>
<li><p>sensory (any element communicating by other means, e.g. colour)</p></li>
<li><p>captchas (most websites provide audio captchas)</p></li>
<li><p>decoration, formatting, etc. (may function as a distraction – should be clearly labelled or supplied so it’s not part of the content of the page)</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-1" class="level5">
<h5>1.2</h5>
<p>Provide alternative for time-based media.</p>
<p>Pre-recorded audio and video material should be accompanied by alternatives that provide the same information through an alternative modality.</p>
<p>Unless the caption is an alternative for text (and is labelled as such), an alternative should be provided that is synchronised with the media.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-2" class="level5">
<h5>1.3</h5>
<p>Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>information, structure and relationships conveyed through presentation should be programmatically determinable or available in text</p></li>
<li><p>when the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined</p></li>
<li><p>sensory characteristics: instructions provided for understanding and operating content should not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-3" class="level5">
<h5>1.4</h5>
<p>Make it easier for users to see and hear content, including separating foreground from background.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>colour should not be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual elements</p></li>
<li><p>if any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information conveyed through colour alone may be missed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>people who are colour-blind</p></li>
<li><p>users with monochrome or non-graphical displays</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>only use colour for aesthetic effect or to reinforce information presented by other means</p></li>
<li><p>ensure that foreground and background colour combinations provide good contrast when viewed by someone with colour-blindness or when viewed on a black and white screen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using a maximum of six colours plus black &amp; white</p></li>
<li><p>choose colours that offer good contrast</p>
<ul>
<li>there are guidelines showing the intrinsic brightness of different colours</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>ensure that colour is only used to provide redundancy by testing the webpage in black and white:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>take a black and white screenshot of the page – if there is good contrast in it, the colour-contrast is probably good</p></li>
<li><p>set all colours using a stylesheet and test with a stylesheet that simulates a monochrome display</p></li>

<section id="operable" class="level4">
<h4>Operable</h4>
<section id="make-all-functionality-available-from-a-keyboard" class="level5">
<h5>2.1 Make all functionality available from a keyboard</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>all functionality of the content should be operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user’s movement and not just the endpoints</p></li>
<li><p>no keyboard trap – if keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then it must be possible to move focus away from that component using only a keyboard interface</p>
<ul>
<li>can happen with e.g. credit card number entering, where if you try to leave the box without entering a number it’s flagged as an error and focus is redirected to the box again</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>##### 2.2 Provide users enough time to read and use content</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if a time limit is set by the content, ensure at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the user is allowed turn off the time limit before encountering it</p></li>
<li><p>the user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting</p></li>
<li><p>the user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example by pressing the space bar), and the user is allowed to extend that time limit at least ten times</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>this may apply e.g. with time limits for discounts or buying tickets</p></li>
<li><p>time-based media may cause problems - screenreaders are event driven, and may report every clock tick to the user if there’s a clock created</p></li>
<li><p>for moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, ensure all of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>anything that starts automatically, lasts more than five seconds, and is presented in parallel with other content has a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it</p></li>
<li><p>for any auto-updating information that starts automatically and is presented in parallel with other content has a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it, or to control the frequency of the update</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>[check these]</p>

<section id="do-not-design-content-in-a-way-that-is-known-to-cause-seizures" class="level5">
<h5>2.3 Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures</h5>
<p>Web pages should not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one-second period.</p>
<ul>
<li>guidelines are actually more complicated than this</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="provide-ways-to-help-users-navigate-and-find-content" class="level5">
<h5>2.4 Provide ways to help users navigate and find content</h5>
<p>A mechanism should be available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>html5 makes this easier</li>
</ul>
<p>Web pages should have titles that describe topic or purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>may save people time, replace glancing</li>
</ul>
<p>If a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.</p>
<p>I should be possible to determined the purpose of each link from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation</p></li>
<li><p>use <code>optgroup</code> to group <code>option</code> elements inside a <code>select</code></p></li>
<li><p>group form controls with <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code></p></li>
<li><p>use nested lists where appropriate</p>
<ul>
<li>screenreaders can look just at the top-level, for example</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>use headings to structure documents, etc.</p></li>

<h4>Understandable</h4>
<section id="make-text-content-readable-and-understandable" class="level5">
<h5>3.1 Make text content readable and understandable</h5>
<p>It should be possible to programmatically determine the default human language of each web page.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>specify the language of the document so that automatic content-retrieval systems can locate documents in the required language</p></li>
<li><p>identify sections (e.g. quotes, captions) in different languages by using the <code>lang</code> attribute so that speech-synthesisers etc. can adjust accordingly</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="make-web-pages-appear-and-operate-in-predictable-ways" class="level5">
<h5>3.2 Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>when any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context</p></li>
<li><p>changing the setting of any user interface component should not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component</p></li>
<li><p>if sighted, you can immediately see what’s changed – not so if relying on a screenreader</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="help-users-avoid-and-correct-mistakes" class="level5">
<h5>3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>if an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error should be identified and the error described to the user in text</p></li>
<li><p>labels or instructions should be provided when content requires user input</p></li>
<li><p>e.g. use labels for your inputs that are linked in the code</p></li>
