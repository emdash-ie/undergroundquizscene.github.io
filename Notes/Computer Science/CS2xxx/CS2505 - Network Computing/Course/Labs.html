<h1>Labs</h1>
<p>Labs start next Thursday (the 23rd February) and last for five weeks. We’ll be divided into two groups, 15:00–16:30 and 16:30–18:00. You can swap from your assigned group into the other group permanently if there’s space – notify the demonstrators.</p>
<ul>
<li>No networking lectures next week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Network Programming Using the Socket API</h2>
<p>The Socket API has been around since the 80s, and hasn’t evolved a lot since then. It’s used everywhere.</p>
<p>The socket is between the application layer and the transport layer. Generally everything from the socket down exists in the kernel space, and everything above exists in the user space.</p>
<p>Two popular transport services available via the socket API:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP</li>
<li>UDP</li>
</ul>
<p>Server has a socket through which it receives and sends. Each client also needs a socket.</p>
<p>Sockets are bound to port numbers – the client needs to know the address of the server and also the port number of the server’s socket.</p>
