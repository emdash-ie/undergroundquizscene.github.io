<h1>What is the Internet?</h1>
<p>Important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many different connection types</li>
<li>The internet is many networks, rather than just one</li>
</ul>
<section id="nuts-bolts-view" class="level2">
<h2>Nuts &amp; Bolts View</h2>
<ul>
<li>Protocols control sending and receiving of messages
<ul>
<li>Examples: TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, Ethernet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The internet is a network of networks
<ul>
<li>It is loosely hierarchical</li>
<li>There’s a public internet and private intranets
<ul>
<li>Private intranets e.g. in companies. Typically use the same protocols as the public internet, the difference is just who has access.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Internet standards
<ul>
<li>RFCs (Requests for comments) are where standards are published.</li>
<li>They’re published by the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force).</li>
<li>Anyone can attend the working groups where standards are defined.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="protocols" class="level2">
<h2>Protocols</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sets of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>People are very good at adapting to nuances of speech and social interaction (including different languages), but computers work best when there is no ambiguity in the communication. This is why we need protocols.</p>
<p>Protocols define:</p>
<ul>
<li>format and order of messages sent and received among network entities</li>
<li>actions taken on message transmission or receipt</li>
</ul>
<section id="request-response-protocols" class="level3">
<h3>Request-Response Protocols</h3>
<p>This covers most network protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client sends a message to a server requesting some information.</li>
<li>The server responds by sending back a message to the client.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="specifying-protocols" class="level3">
<h3>Specifying Protocols</h3>
<p>You need to specify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The set of message types (e.g. request, response, error)</li>
<li>The format of each message</li>
<li>The action to be taken when a message is received, including what response to send</li>
</ul>
<p>If the specification is unambiguous, different implementations should be compatible.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementing-protocols" class="level3">
<h3>Implementing Protocols</h3>
<ul>
<li>Network protocols are usually implemented in software.</li>
<li>The software must faithfully implement the protocol specification.
<ul>
<li>The choice of programming language and operating system doesn’t matter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This software must be installed at the client and server computers.
<ul>
<li>As long as the specification was adhered to, independent implementations <em>should</em> work together.</li>

<h3>Types of Protocols</h3>
<ul>
<li>each protocol is designed for a specific purpose</li>
<li>the most crucial protocols allow messages to be routed to the right destination and reliably delivered
<ul>
<li>their operation is largely invisible to end-users</li>
</ul></li>
<li>other protocols are more familiar, e.g.:

<h1>Network Core</h1>
<p>What we need to do (for the last section and this one and possibly in the future) is understand how different technologies differ across a number of different criteria.</p>
<p>The core of the network is made up of routers and switches.</p>
<p>The fundamental question is: how is data transferred through the net?</p>
<p>How can we forward data in the best way possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fastest</li>
<li>Most efficient</li>
<li>Most accurate?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to transfer data:</p>
<ul>
<li>circuit switching:
<ul>
<li>dedicated circuit per call</li>
<li>this is used for the telephone net</li>
</ul></li>
<li>packet switching:
<ul>
<li>data is sent through the net in discrete chunks</li>
<li>this is used for the internet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Today’s lecture is about why we use packet switching and not circuit switching.</p>
<section id="circuit-switching" class="level2">
<h2>Circuit Switching</h2>
<p>End to end resources are reserved for a call between two endpoints.</p>
<ul>
<li>link bandwidth is the switch capacity</li>
<li>resources are dedicated – there’s no sharing</li>
<li>performance is circuit-like/guaranteed</li>
<li>call setup is required
<ul>
<li>you need to tell the network in advance what you need</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="network-resources" class="level3">
<h3>Network Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Divide them (e.g. bandwidth) into pieces
<ul>
<li>pieces are allocated to calls</li>
<li>resource piece is idle if not used by owning call (no sharing)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="fdm-and-tdm" class="level3">
<h3>FDM and TDM</h3>
<section id="fdm-frequency-division-multiplexing" class="level4">
<h4>FDM (Frequency-division multiplexing)</h4>
<p>You allocate a different frequency to each user.</p>
<p>This is used in cable tv.</p>
</section>
<section id="tdm-time-division-multiplexing" class="level4">
<h4>TDM (Time-division multiplexing)</h4>
<p>Each user gets a time quantum.</p>
<pre><code>* First user goes
* Then second
* …</code></pre>
<p>Each user gets the full channel for their time period.</p>
<p>The size of the time quanta determines how many users you can support over a fixed unit of time.</p>
<p>TDM is used in the digital telephone network.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="packet-switching" class="level2">
<h2>Packet Switching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Divide file into chunks, send them one after the other</li>
<li>Packets from different users share resources</li>
<li>Each packet uses the full link bandwidth</li>
<li>Resources used as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Resource contention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate resource demand can exceed amount available</li>
<li>congestion: packets queue, wait for link use
<ul>
<li>the queue can overflow and packets can be lost</li>
</ul></li>
<li>store and forward: packets move one hop at a time

<li>node receives complete packet before forwarding</li>

</ul>
<section id="statistical-multiplexing" class="level3">
<h3>Statistical Multiplexing</h3>
<p>Multiplex packets from users based on a statistical model onto one link.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="store-and-forward" class="level3">
<h3>Store and Forward</h3>
<ul>

</section>
</section>
<section id="packet-switching-vs.circuit-switching" class="level2">
<h2>Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Packet switching allows more users to use the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume each user needs 100 kb/s when “active”, and is active 10% of the time.</p>
<p>In circuit switching, we can support 10 users on a 1 Mb/s link.</p>
<p>In packet switching, we can support at least 10, depending on the probability of users being active at the same time.</p>
<p>If we have 20 users at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>In circuit switching, 10 users get no connection, they have to wait till the circuit is free</li>
<li>In packet switching, 20 users get a connection, but are not getting the speed they need</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have 1 user:</p>
<ul>
<li>In packet switching, the user gets the full bandwidth</li>
<li>In circuit switching, the user still gets one tenth of the bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<section id="winner" class="level3">
<h3>Winner</h3>
<p>Packet switching is good for bursty (VBR rather than CBR) data:</p>
<ul>
<li>resource sharing</li>
<li>simpler, no call setup</li>
</ul>
<p>But it has excessive congestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>packet delay and loss
<ul>
<li>protocols are needed for reliable data transfer, and congestion control</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>How can you provide circuit-like behaviour?</p>
<pre><code>* we need bandwidth guarantees for audio/video apps
* this is still an unsolved problem - most solutions are not widely used</code></pre>

<section id="internet-structure" class="level2">
<h2>Internet Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>very roughly hierarchical</li>
<li>At the centre, “tier-1” ISPs (e.g. Global Crossing, Level 3, Sprint, AT&amp;T)
<ul>
<li>They provide national/international coverage</li>
<li>They treat each other as equals</li>
<li>They interconnect (peer) privately
<ul>
<li>This to allow customers from different ISPs to access through their ISP to another</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Tier-2” ISPs: smaller (often regional) ISPs
<ul>
<li>These connect to one or more ISPs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Tier-3” ISPs and local ISPs
<ul>
<li>last hop (“access”) network (closest to end systems)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A packet passes through many networks.</p>
<p>As a general rule, you don’t want too many hops, as the more hops lead to a greater chance to encountering congestion.</p>
<p>There’s a utility called traceroute on unix systems which can tell which networks your communication goes through.</p>

<h1>Network Performance Metrics</h1>
<section id="how-do-loss-and-delay-occur" class="level2">
<h2>How Do Loss and Delay Occur?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Packets queue in router buffers</li>
<li>Packet arrival rate to the link exceeds the output link capacity</li>
<li>Packets queue, wait for turn</li>
<li>Arriving packets are dropped if there are no free buffers</li>
</ul>
<p>Transmission delay is a function of bandwidth. If you have a higher bandwidth you can push things onto the connection faster.</p>
<p>There’s also queueing delay.</p>
<section id="four-sources-of-packet-delay" class="level3">
<h3>Four Sources of Packet Delay</h3>

<h1>Network</h1>
<p>Common enough to have questions where you’re given a network and you have to work out the delay.</p>
<p>Start by writing this equation: <code>D = T + P + Q</code> (processing delay is ignored as it’s usually not significant).</p>
<ul>
<li>Next think about which of these you need to calculate
<ul>
<li>If there are no routers there’s no queueing delay</li>

<h2>Internet Scenario</h2>
<p>The per-connection end-to-end throughput is min(Rs, Rc, R/10), where R is the shared link in the middle for 10 connections. In practice it’s nearly always Rc.</p>
