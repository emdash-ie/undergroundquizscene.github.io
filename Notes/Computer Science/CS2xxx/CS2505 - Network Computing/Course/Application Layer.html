<h1>Application Layer</h1>
<p>We use the internet to do a lot of different things – the applications are different in terms of what they expect from the network underneath.</p>
<p>As we go through, think about how each application is different from the ones we’ve already seen in terms of how it interacts with the network. The further down the stack you go, the fewer protocols there are.</p>
<p>We will look at a lot of examples – we’re aiming to learn the principles and concepts, not the particular details of any particular protocol.</p>
<section id="creating-a-network-app" class="level2">
<h2>Creating a Network App</h2>
<p>Write programs that</p>
<ul>
<li>run on different end systems</li>
<li>communicate over the network</li>
<li>e.g. web server software communicates with browser software</li>
</ul>
<p>No need to write software for network-core devices, means anyone can go and write an application that communicates with any protocol, and it’ll work over the internet.</p>
<p>Having applications only on end systems allows for rapid app development and propagation.</p>
<section id="internet-addressing" class="level3">
<h3>Internet Addressing</h3>
<p>Every computer on the internet gets a unique IP address:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is assigned when it connects to the network</li>
<li>Used to identify the destination when sending a packet</li>
<li>Used by receivers to check who sent the packet (and to reply)</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience we often use hostnames, but these are mapped to a corresponding IP address when sending a packet.</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. cs1.ucc.ie -&gt; 143.239.75.218</li>
</ul>
<p>Using hostnames is easier and less error-prone for people.</p>

<h3>Application Architectures</h3>
<ul>
<li>client-server
<ul>
<li>including data centres / cloud computing</li>
<li>e.g. web server – expect it to always be available, whereas clients come and go</li>
<li>always-on host with permanent IP address</li>
<li>clients may have dynamic IP addresses</li>
<li>clients don’t communicate directly with each other</li>
</ul></li>
<li>peer-to-peer
<ul>
<li>bunch of clients get together and exchange info</li>
<li>no always-on server</li>
<li>peers are intermittently connected and change IPs</li>
<li>highly scalable but difficult to manage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>hybrid of those
<ul>
<li>e.g. Skype
<ul>
<li>voice over IP P2P application</li>
<li>centralised server to find the address of a remote party (and tell what address you’re currently at)</li>
<li>client-client connection is direct, not through a server</li>

<h2>Processes Communicating</h2>
<p>Within the same host, two processes communicate using inter-process communication, which is defined by the OS.</p>
<p>Processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>A client process initiates communications</li>
<li>A server process waits to be contacted</li>
<li>applications with P2P architectures have client processes and server processes</li>

<li>message syntax
<ul>
<li>what fields in the message are and how the fields are delineated</li>

<li>message semantics
<ul>
<li>meaning of the information in the fields</li>

<section id="popular-internet-transport-protocols" class="level2">
<h2>Popular Internet Transport Protocols</h2>
<p>Only two are widely used, though many others exist. TCP is dominant (about 98% of traffic), though UDP is likely to grow going forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
<ul>
<li>very complex</li>
<li>provides reliability end-to-end</li>
<li>uses sequence numbers to detect lost or out-of-order packets
<ul>
<li>these are retransmitted (extra delay)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>additional features to control the sending rate so as to match the available network and receiver buffer capacity
<ul>
<li>features to try to avoid congestion on the network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>doesn’t provide:
<ul>
<li>timing guarantees</li>
<li>minimum throughput guarantees</li>
<li>security</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>UDP (Unreliable Datagram Protocol)
<ul>
<li>much simpler than TCP</li>
<li>very basic delivery service that offers no guarantees about delivery between sending and receiving processes</li>
<li>does not provide:
<ul>
<li>timing guarantees</li>
<li>rate control</li>
<li>minimum throughput guarantees</li>
<li>security</li>
</ul></li>
<li>very common for UDP to be disabled because it has features that network admins hate
<ul>
<li>firewalls usually block it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Programs like Skype try to use UDP if it’s available, but revert to TCP if it isn’t</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Question to think about: why use UDP?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="applications" class="level1">
<h1>Applications</h1>
<p>Concentrate on the differences and commonalities between all of these applications.</p>
<section id="web-and-http" class="level2">
<h2>Web and HTTP</h2>
<p>Some jargon first:</p>
<ul>
<li>web page consists of objects</li>
<li>objects can be html files, jpeg images, java applets, audio files</li>
<li>base html file which includes several referenced objects
<ul>
<li>each object is addressable by a URL</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="http" class="level3">
<h3>HTTP</h3>
<p>Doesn’t matter what the clients are running (OS, programs) as long as they generate requests in the right format (http).</p>
<ul>
<li>Always uses TCP.
<ul>
<li>mostly because it needs reliability</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="tcp-basics" class="level3">
<h3>TCP Basics</h3>
<p>TCP requires the sender and receiver to set up a connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>before any user data is transferred</li>
<li>has to be closed again when finished</li>
</ul>
<p>This incurs delays (round-trip time delays - RTT). These delays are both for open and closing connections, and both of those areas are important.</p>
<p>When designing applications, we need to think about how the performance of the transport layer affects the performance of our applications.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to design applications without knowing about the performance characteristics of lower layers. Don’t choose TCP without knowing about its efficiency.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="http-1" class="level1">
<h1>HTTP</h1>
<ul>
<li>The client initiates a TCP connection (creates a socket) to the server on port 80</li>
<li>The server accepts TCP connection from the client</li>
<li>HTTP messages (application-;ayer protocol messages) exchanged between browser and web server</li>
<li>TCP connection closed</li>
</ul>
<section id="stateless-protocol" class="level2">
<h2>Stateless Protocol</h2>
<p>At the protocol level (i.e. not cookies) http is stateless. This makes the protocol simpler.</p>
<p>State makes protocols very complex:</p>
<ul>
<li>past history (state) must be maintained</li>
<li>if server/client crashes, their views of state may be inconsistent, must be reconciled</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="non-persistent-http" class="level2">
<h2>Non-Persistent HTTP</h2>
<p>Because we choose TCP (because we need reliability), we incur performance overheads for setting up the connection. This leads to some strange behaviour.</p>
<p>If we want to load a page with several images, the setup and closing of the TCP connection is repeated for each image, even if the images are on the same host. So we incur a lot of delay.</p>
<p>First optimisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send off image TCP requests in parallel instead of in series</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally there’s a limit of about 10 parallel TCP connections per server. Lots looks like a DOS attack.</p>
</section>
<section id="persistent-http" class="level2">
<h2>Persistent HTTP</h2>
<p>HTTP 1.1 introduced persistent HTTP, where multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection between a client and a server. It’s used when there’s a bunch of objects on one server.</p>
<p>Raises the question of when to close the connection.</p>
</section>
<section id="pipelining" class="level2">
<h2>Pipelining</h2>
<p>Next optimisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send requests in parallel</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t very widely used, and there’ll be an explanation later.</p>
</section>
<section id="http-messages" class="level2">
<h2>HTTP Messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>In ASCII (human-readable)
<ul>
<li>Binary formats are much more efficient (each ASCII character takes a byte)</li>
<li>But binary formats are a pain to deal with</li>
<li>You can easily view and debug ASCII protocols</li>
<li>Binary-based protocols tend to be preferred where link efficiency is important, otherwise ASCII</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="http-requests" class="level2">
<h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
<p><code>HEAD</code> is sometimes useful to e.g. check the size of a file or when it was last modified, without downloading it.</p>

<section id="cookies" class="level1">
<h1>Cookies</h1>
<ul>
<li>Part of the application but kept in the header for the http protocol.</li>
<li>State information, but not protocol-level information
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t tie together multiple http sessions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you</li>

<li>They can learn a lot about you as a real person</li>

</section>
<section id="web-caching" class="level1">
<h1>Web Caching</h1>
<ul>
<li>All requests go through a proxy server</li>
<li>Proxy stores webpages requested
<ul>
<li>Can then deliver the cached version instead of sending a request for the original again</li>
<li>This decreases load on the origin server and reduces latency for cached pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have to empty the cache as it fills</li>
</ul>
<p>Caching provides great reduction in congestion, but won’t work for https traffic (each page is encrypted so it can only be viewed by whoever requested it).</p>
<p>Also, what about websites which change? How do you know whether a website has changed and you therefore need to get the newest version.</p>
<p>To get around the latter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a conditional GET – only get it if it was modified since the attached date and time.
<ul>
<li>If it hasn’t been modified, then an error is sent back
<ul>
<li>In this case use the cache version</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are other problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cache can’t provide customised experience because it doesn’t understand your cookie</li>
<li>Personalised advertising is ruined</li>
<li>Content providers don’t get any detailed information about how you’re using their page
<ul>
<li>e.g. it’s too slow</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Content providers can put a “do not cache” line in the header, and most do this for a lot of their content.</p>
</section>
<section id="http2" class="level1">
<h1>HTTP/2</h1>
<p>Main goal is to reduce page load times:</p>
<ul>
<li>binary encoding and header compression
<ul>
<li>binary rather than ASCII</li>
</ul></li>
<li>server can “push” content that it believes the client will need, e.g. interdependent objects
<ul>
<li>potentially huge benefits</li>
<li>might send you stuff you don’t want, which might cost you a lot or be annoying</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eliminates head-of-the-line blocking from HTTP/1.1 for pipelining by allowing asynchronous request/response
<ul>
<li>answers had to came in order in HTTP/1.1 – server could work in parallel, but couldn’t send later responses before earlier ones</li>

<h3>BitTorrent</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>uses TCP for reliability</p></li>
<li>pull-based
<ul>
<li>you tell peers you want it, they don’t know otherwise</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>designed in a way that encourages you to share the pieces you have with other users</p></li>
<li>torrent definition
<ul>
<li>group of peers exchanging pieces of a file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>tracker normally gives you a subset of the entire number of users
<ul>
<li>tracker is specified in the torrent descriptor file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>while downloading, peers must upload pieces to other peers
<ul>
<li>once finished, you can leave or stay</li>
<li>BitTorrent is reputation-based – if you often seed, you will get better connections (though it won’t go far above your connection speed because that would be a waste)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>neighbours are the set of users you’re connected to on the overlay network</p></li>
<li>need to randomly select a peer every now and then and send files to them in order to allow new users to join the network
<ul>
<li>other than that it’s by how much they’re sending you</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>high upload rate important to P2P</p></li>

<h3>DASH</h3>
<ul>

<li>this isn’t specified in the standard</li>
