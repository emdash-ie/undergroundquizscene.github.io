<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<hr />
<p>The assignment is now (Monday 7th November) up on Moodle. Deadline is Friday 18th November.</p>
<p>The database description is not finished yet, it needs to be fleshed out. There’s placeholder text in some parts at the moment. It’ll be ready by tomorrow morning (Tuesday 8th November).</p>
<p>Your files must be named correctly, or you will lose marks.</p>
<p>There will be 5 assignments, which will all be to do with the database and xml that we see in this assignment.</p>
<p>If we’re doing ok with the labs, we should be fine with these.</p>
<p>For these assignments, we will need variables, as many of the tables in the database cross-reference one another.</p>
