<h1>I/O Devices</h1>
<ul>
<li>Main issue is heterogeneity
<ul>
<li>there’s a vast range of I/O devices, and they can have very different forms and performance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each has a driver to help operate it
<ul>
<li>driver forms part of the kernel</li>
<li>driver provides <em>only</em> the direct control of the device.</li>
<li>driver works directly with the controller of the device</li>
<li>.. makes sure the device is operated correctly by the OS</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>But we may have classes of devices of the same type, and so cost-effective operation requires more from the OS. (don’t understand what this means)</p>
<ul>
<li>Class of device may be whether it’s block or character.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can create virtual copies of devices in memory to act as buffers, so that one device can be allocated to different processes simultaneously, with each waiting on the physical resource – gives a performance gain over each waiting to connect to the specific device with no virtual representation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to virtualise two cores with one physical core.</p>
<ul>
<li>additional software layer
<ul>
<li>allows homogeneous representation of I/O devices
<ul>
<li>this is better (it’s an engineering principle)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I/O space is brought in line with the file system
<ul>
<li>same set of operations executed with files and I/O devices
<ul>
<li>major benefit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>need same or similar namespace
<ul>
<li>qualified names used to address a device</li>
<li>so now each process can have a name and an operation, where the name can be a file or an I/O device, and the operations are the same for both</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Broadly two classes of I/O device – character and block.</p>
<p>Have also a major and minor device number (minor device number selects instance of a resource).</p>
<p>Major number used to identify position in character or block table, where there are pointers to op procedures (entry points in the driver).</p>
<ul>
<li>disk controller handles waiting on sectors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I/O schedulers operate in the kernel, in co-operation with the drivers.</p>

<h1>(Week 8)</h1>
<p>In Linux we have block and character devices, and I/O control is different for the two.</p>
<section id="example" class="level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>application running on the computer wants to write using the parallel port</p></li>
<li><p>there’s a file descriptor that has all the details required to manage that connection</p></li>
<li><p><code>write()</code> calls <code>lp_write()</code> which prepares for the output operation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“prepares” as in for the specific device</p>
<ul>
<li><p>e.g. split the output into basic operations (i.e. one operation corresponds to a buffer)</p></li>
<li><p>buffer-size data transfers will occur</p></li>
<li><p>need a starting pointer and the amount of data to be printed</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>driver in kernel memory space, controller separate</p></li>
<li><p>controller uses an interrupt to tell the computer when each page is finished (then the next page is sent)</p></li>
<li><p>also need a lock mechanism to uniquely allocate a printer to a particular process, for the duration of the print operation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>printer is then unlocked after</p></li>
<li><p>other requests for the resource are queued until they can be processed</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Interrupt handler can take some steps to complete, so is divided into upper half and lower half.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the upper half detects what has happened and acknowledges it</p>
<ul>
<li>only does quick things</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the lower half does any further processing required</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>Three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>motion sensors</li>
<li>environmental sensors</li>
<li>position sensors</li>
</ol>
<p>Most sensors have an official sensor type. There can be several sensors of the same type, e.g. two proximity sensors or two accelerometers.</p>
<p>Some sensors are hardware but some are software sensors – these consider input from different hardware sensors.</p>
<p>The OS allows users to get the raw data from sensors and use it in applications.</p>
<p>For any sensor, the two important parameters are the sampling rate and the accuracy.</p>
<section id="android-sensor-subsystem" class="level3">
<h3>Android Sensor Subsystem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Application framework is different, as are libraries</li>
</ul>
<section id="applications-framework" class="level4">
<h4>Applications Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>One sensor can be connected to several applications.</p></li>
<li><p>important that applications might not get the latency and sampling rate they expect</p></li>
<li><p>when the last application unregisters from a sensor, the framework sends a request to the HAL to deactivate the sensor (de-allocate resources such as buffers and flags)</p></li>
