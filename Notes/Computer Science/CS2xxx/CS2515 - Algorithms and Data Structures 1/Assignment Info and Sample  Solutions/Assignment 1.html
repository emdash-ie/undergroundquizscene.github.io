<h2>DLL Music Library</h2>
<p>We’re using a doubly-linked list to represent a music library management system. You could do this without a doubly-linked list, but you need to do it with one for this assignment.</p>
<p>You have the option of implementing the music library as a DLL, or implementing the DLL separately and using it in the music library implementation – either’s fine.</p>
<p>He suggests using a sorting algorithm you already know, such as bubble sort, for sorting the music library, as complexity will not be important.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>It’s due Thursday 27th of October at 6pm.</p>
<p>It’s submitted through the command line like with CS1117 last year.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>submit-ADS1 [filename]</code> – Note that this has been changed from what we were initially told.</li>
</ul>
<p>All work submitted must be your own work.</p>

<section id="recommendations" class="level2">
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Dr. Brown recommends you draw pictures as you go, rather than just working with code. It helps to give you a mental model of what all the references mean.</p>
<p>Specifically for the <code>swap_adjacent</code> method, he recommends assigning the four nodes (the two nodes passed in, the node before them, and the node after them) to variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, and <code>w</code> when you start out. This leads to longer code but makes it more likely that you’ll get it working. Once you have it working you can remove these extra assignments.</p>
