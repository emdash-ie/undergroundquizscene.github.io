<h1>Representing Sequences with Lists</h1>
<hr />
<section id="everything-in-python-is-an-object" class="level2">
<h2>Everything in Python is an Object</h2>
<pre><code>x=3
y=3
z=y
y=4</code></pre>
<p>The above code is implemented as follows in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 is an integer object, stored in memory</li>
<li>x is a variable which references that object</li>
<li>y is a variable which references the same object – only 1 copy of a basic type</li>
<li>z is a variable which references the same object</li>
<li>y is then changed to point to a different object</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the same for bools, floats, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="user-defined-classes-and-objects" class="level2">
<h2>User-defined Classes and Objects</h2>
<p>Every time we create an object from a class, Python creates a new object in memory:</p>
<pre><code>c1 = Card(3, 3)
c2 = Card(3, 3)
c3 = c2
c2 = Card(6, 1)</code></pre>
<p>Here however, c1 and c2 are pointing to separate objects in memory, not both pointing to the same object.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-lists-are-array-based-lists" class="level2">
<h2>Python Lists Are Array-Based Lists</h2>
<p>A list in Python is a sequence of references to objects. The references in the list are maintained in a contiguous physical block in memory, packed one after another in sequence – this is called an array-based list.</p>
<p>A list of ints is a sequence of references to int objects.</p>
</section>
<section id="tuples" class="level2">
<h2>Tuples</h2>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of references to objects. The length and content of a tuple cannot change.</p>
<p>The implementation is similar to lists, but it can take advantage of the fact that they can’t change.</p>
</section>
<section id="space-required-for-a-list" class="level2">
<h2>Space Required for a List</h2>
<p>Since a list is a sequence of references, the amount of space required for a list depends on the number of elements and not the type of the elements.</p>
</section>
<section id="sequence-operations" class="level2">
<h2>Sequence Operations</h2>
<section id="accessing-elements-by-index" class="level3">
<h3>Accessing Elements by Index</h3>
<p>Since Python knows how much space each entry in a list takes regardless of what’s in the list and knows the location in memory of the start of the list, accessing an element by index only takes this computation:</p>
<ul>
<li>start address + size * index</li>
</ul>
<p>So accessing elements by index takes constant time. It is O(1).</p>
</section>
<section id="searching-for-an-element" class="level3">
<h3>Searching for an Element</h3>
<pre><code>for x in mylist:
    if x == 4:
        return True
return</code></pre>
<p>The condition <code>if 4 in mylist</code> in Python runs an algorithm equivalent to the one above (though written in another language). For objects it’s the same:</p>
<pre><code>c1 = Card(3, 3)
for card in mylist:
    if card.is_equals(c1):
        return True
return False</code></pre>
<p>This operation is O(n).</p>
</section>
<section id="appending-to-a-list" class="level3">
<h3>Appending to a List</h3>
<p>The list has space for each reference set aside in memory. What happens when we increase the size of the list?</p>
<p>In the best case, Python will create the space at the end and put the reference there.</p>
<p>If that space is currently occupied by other data, Python will find a new space in memory and put the whole list there. Python needs to keep all the data together in order to find elements by index as we saw.</p>
<p>So appending items to a list may require reservation of a new area in memory for the entire list, and time to copy the list elements across.</p>
<section id="naive-append" class="level4">
<h4>Naive Append</h4>
<pre><code>mylist = []
for i in range(1000):
    mylist.append(i)
    </code></pre>
<p>In the worst case (the whole list has to be moved each time a new item is appended), this will take <code>0.5 * 999 * 1000</code> copy operations, which is 499500 copy operations.</p>
<p>This is O(n squared), where n is the size the list may grow to.</p>
<p>This is not what Python does. A list of length 0 takes up 36 bytes, length 1–4 takes 52 bytes, length 5–8 takes 68 bytes, and so on.</p>
<p>When asked to append, if the list is full, Python creates a bigger list with size based on the current list.</p>
</section>
<section id="complexity-of-list-doubling" class="level4">
<h4>Complexity of List Doubling</h4>
<p>Policy: each time we must grow the list, double its size. Suppose we are unlikely, and must copy the list each time we grow it.</p>
<p>To create a list that reaches size n, this will take:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 assignment +</li>
<li>1 copy operation + 1 assignment +</li>
<li>2 copy operations + 2 assignments +</li>
<li>4 copy operations + 4 assignments +</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>n/2 copy operations + n/2 assignments</li>
</ul>
<p>This is n copies and n assignments. Making a list of size 1000 takes 2000 assignments in the worst case, while the naive method took 500000 assignments.</p>
<p>Doubling the size each time space is needed takes O(n) to build a list of size n. Average cost of a single append is O(1).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="popping-from-a-list" class="level3">
<h3>Popping from a List</h3>
<p>Popping is taking an element out of a list and using it. Python’s lists have no spaces in memory, so the list must close up. Every item after the popped item must be moved forward.</p>
<p>For a list of length n, pop(i) takes (n - 1 - i) copies. Pop is O(n).</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-space-management" class="level3">
<h3>Memory Space Management</h3>
<p>Pop and other operations all create empty cells at the end of the list. Python will manage the space, and when the proportion of empty space exceeds a limit, Python will release the space for other uses.</p>
